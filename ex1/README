Pulled ubuntu image and ran the container locally
	- docker run -it ubuntu

Ran apt update to update the package repo
	- apt update

Installed dnsutils to be able to use dig
	- apt install dnsutils

Used +short to only get the ip address
	- dig +short cloudflare.com
 
output: 104.16.132.229
        104.16.133.229 
 
Installed vim as a text editor
	 - apt install vim

Added "8.8.8.8 google-dns" to the hosts file to map ip to dns locally (it bypasses further dns lookup and maps the hostname directly to the ip)
  - vim /etc/hosts
  
Installed netcat to check google-dns for open DNS port 
 	- apt install netcat-openbsd
	- nc -zv google-dns 53 : -z means we use the command just to scan ports and -v stands for verbose

Edited the resolv.conf file
	- vim /etc/resolv.conf
	- changed nameserver to 8.8.8.8
Ran dig cloudflare.com again and got the same result (not sure if I should've got something different)

Installed nginx and started the service
	- apt install nginx
	- service nginx start
	- service nginx status
	output: * nginx is running
Checked the nginx port by using the -tuapen options when running netstat. T and u stand for tcp and udp, a displays all active connections, p displays the pid, e shows extra information (such as the user) and n shows the ip adresses in numeric format.
	- netstat -tuapen | grep nginx

bonus:

Went to one of the configuration files specified in nginx.conf (could have also went to sites-available/default) and changed the port nginx is listening on
	- vim /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Went to /var/www/html, where the nginx index.html file is located and changed the title
	- vim /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
