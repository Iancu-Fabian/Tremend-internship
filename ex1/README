Pulled ubuntu image and ran the container locally
	- docker run -it ubuntu

Ran apt update to update the package repo
	- apt update

Installed dnsutils to be able to use dig
	- apt install dnsutils

Used +short to only get the ip address
	- dig +short cloudflare.com
 
output: 104.16.132.229
        104.16.133.229 
 
Installed vim as a text editor
	 - apt install vim

Added "8.8.8.8 google-dns" to the hosts file to map ip to dns locally (it bypasses further dns lookup and maps the hostname directly to the ip)
  - vim /etc/hosts
  
Installed netcat to check google-dns for open DNS port 
 	- apt install netcat-openbsd
	- nc -zv google-dns 53


Edited the resolv.conf file
	- vim /etc/resolv.conf
	- changed nameserver to 8.8.8.8
Ran dig again 


- apt install nginx
- service nginx start
- service nginx status: * nginx is running
- netstat -tuapen | grep nginx
